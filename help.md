# I want to help translate DEL!

Welcome and thanks!

### Translator requirements
- You must be fluent in English and the language(s) you will be translating DEL to.
- You must stay in the DEL Discord server while you are a translator.

Do not use Google Translate or similar automated translation services to translate DEL!

## How to apply

1. [Join the DEL Discord Server](https://discord.gg/WeCer3J) if you aren't in it already.
2. Go to [translate.discordextremelist.xyz](https://translate.discordextremelist.xyz) and login to Crowdin.
3. If you see a language you want to translate to listed, then click it and click the Join button. In the message, make sure you include your Discord username (@carolina.slay). **Then do step 4.**  
If you don't see the language(s) listed, then don't worry! Just proceed to step 4.
4. DM @advaith in the DEL server with your Crowdin username and the language(s) you want to translate to. Include any language(s) you have requested to join in Crowdin and any language(s) that you want to translate to but are not yet showing in the translation site.

If you do not DM advaith or send us a message on the server otherwise, your request will be rejected. Please make sure to contact us on Discord!!
