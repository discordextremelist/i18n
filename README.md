## Where can I make translation changes?
You can make changes on [our Crowdin Project](https://translate.discordextremelist.xyz)!

## What languages are you looking for translators in?
All languages! If the language isn't currently on the Crowdin homepage, it just means we haven't got any translators for it yet... Just ask and we'll add it!

## Someone's already translating the language I want to translate in. Does this mean I can't participate?
No! The more the merrier, as more people reviewing translations improves accuracy.
