Merhaba! Discord'un geliştiriciler için sunduğu Servis Koşulları (<https://discord.dev/legal>) gereğince, botunuzun kendine ait bir Gizlilik Politikası olması gerekmekte.

**What is a Privacy Policy?**
According to Wikipedia, "A privacy policy is a statement or legal document that discloses some or all of the ways a party gathers, uses, discloses, and manages a customer or client's data."

**What does my Privacy Policy need to have?**
Please read this message for information about what your privacy policy needs to include: https://advaith.is-in-hyper.space/1faafadb0f.png

**Why do I need to add this?**
You need a valid privacy policy in order to submit a bot on Discord Extreme List and in order to follow Discord's Developer Terms of Service.

**Nasıl bir tane ekleyebilirim? Do I need a website?**
No, you just need to have one accessible to your users, If that's a website, GitHub Gist, command, etc.

**What if I don't store data?**
You _still_ need a privacy policy that says "We do not store data" followed by a way to contact you.

**I need help with this!**
First, have a look at some examples and read all the text above, then feel free to send a message to a staff member!
Please **do not** ping a staff member and just wait for a reply. Sabrınız için teşekkür ederiz!
