Merhaba! Discord'un Geliştirici Hizmet Şartları'nda (<https://discord.dev/legal>) yapılan bir değişiklik nedeniyle artık botunuz için bir Gizlilik Politikasına ihtiyacınız var!

**What is a Privacy Policy?** According to Wikipedia, "A privacy policy is a statement or legal document that discloses some or all of the ways a party gathers, uses, discloses, and manages a customer or client's data."

**What does my Privacy Policy need to have?** Please read this message for information about what your privacy policy needs to include: https://advaith.is-in-hyper.space/1faafadb0f.png

**Why do I need to add this?** You need a valid privacy policy in order to submit a bot on Discord Extreme List and in order to follow Discord's Developer Terms of Service.

**How can I add one? Do I need a website?** No, you just need to have one accessible to your users, If that's a website, GitHub Gist, command, etc.

**What if I don't store data?** You *still* need a privacy policy that says "We do not store data" followed by a way to contact you.

**I need help with this!** First, have a look at some examples and read all the text above, then feel free to send a message to a staff member! Please __do not__ ping a staff member and just wait for a reply. Thank you for the patience!

**Example Privacy Policies** A list of good valid example privacy policies can be found here: <https://gist.github.com/DuckMasterAl/f5d20d091adf11fe87dcb4887c8b8a71>
