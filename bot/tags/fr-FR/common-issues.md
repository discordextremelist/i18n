**Problèmes courants qui empêcheront l'approbation de votre bot**
1. Aucune vérification hiérarchique des rôles.
2. Erreurs de commande inconnues.
3. Le lien d'invitation est généré en demandant la permission administrateur.
4. Commands ask for wrong permissions (For ex: warn command asks for administrator etc).
5. Level up messages that are not configurable.
6. Commands returning NSFW content in an SFW channel.
7. No error handler/messages (missing permissions, missing arguments, wrong arguments and so on).
8. Say command (or any other that resend what author said) being able to mention everyone or unmentionable roles. (depends on permissions checks).
9. Commands do what they aren't supposed to do (for ex: mute doesn't mute, kick doesn't kick and so on (obviously when bot isn't missing any permissions)).
10. Privacy Policy is invalid.
