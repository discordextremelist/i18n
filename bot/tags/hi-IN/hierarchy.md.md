**What is a role hierarchy?** A role hierarchy is where the bot checks if the author’s role is lower than the targets role. For example, you don't want Moderators being able to ban Administrators.

**How can I enable the role hierarchy?** Check if the author’s highest role is less than the target’s highest role. If it is then return an error.

**Why should I add this?**
1. You need to add this to get your bot approved.
2. It makes it so that helpers can’t warn/mute admins since that doesn’t seem right.

**I don’t know how to do this... Someone help me!** Ask in your bots' support server or <#648996487371554834>.
