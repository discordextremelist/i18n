**Common issues that will prevent your bot from being approved**
1. No role hierarchy checks.
2. Unknown command errors.
3. Invite link is generated to ask for administrator.
4. Commands ask for wrong permissions (For ex: warn command asks for administrator etc).
5. Level up messages that are not configurable.
6. Commands returning NSFW content in an SFW channel.
7. No error handler/messages (missing permissions, missing arguments, wrong arguments and so on).
8. Say command (or any other that resend what author said) being able to mention everyone or unmentionable roles. (depends on permissions checks).
9. Commands do what they aren't supposed to do (for ex: mute doesn't mute, kick doesn't kick and so on (obviously when bot isn't missing any permissions)).
10. Privacy Policy is invalid.

**I refuse to fix any of the issues** If you refuse to fix the issues that will prevent bot from approval - we'll deny your bot.
